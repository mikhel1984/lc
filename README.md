# LuaCalculus
**LuaCalculus** is a **Lua** based program for mathematical computations. It is also a library of objects and functions for solving the different mathematical tasks. Each module is independent from others and can be used standalone.

Following modules are available now:
* _array_ - multidimensional collections of elements
* _bigint_ - arbitrary long integer numbers
* _complex_ - complex number operations
* _const_ - collection of constants
* _files_ - some routines for working with files
* _gnuplot_ - use **Gnuplot** for creating images
* _numeric_ - some numerical evaluations (integration, differentiation, solving equations)
* _polynom_ - manipulations with polynomials 
* _rational_ - operations with rational number
* _set_ - manipulations with sets
* _special_ - special functions
* _stat_ - some statistical functions
* _struct_ - base data structures
* _units_ - units conversation and other manipulations

Program includes a help system for most of the functions and modules. It also can be translated to other languages. Available now languages:
* _English (default)_
* _Esperanto (eo)_
* _Russian (ru)_

**LuaCalculus** works in standard **Lua** interpreter with version at least _5.3_. To run it, call
