# Sonata LC
**Sonata Lua Calculus** is a **Lua** based program for mathematical computations. It is also a library of objects and functions for solving the different mathematical tasks. Each module is independent from others and can be used standalone.

Following modules are available now:
* [array](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-arrays) - multidimensional collections of elements
* [bigint](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-bigint) - arbitrary long integer numbers
* [complex](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-complex) - complex numbers
* _const_ - collection of constants
* _files_ - routines for working with data files
* [gnuplot](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-gnuplot) - use **Gnuplot** for creating images
* [matrix](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-matrix) - operations with matrices
* [numeric](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-numeric) - some numerical evaluations, such as integration, differentiation, solving equations
* [polynom](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-polynom) - manipulations with polynomial objects
* [rational](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-rational) - operations with rational numbers
* [set](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-set) - operations with sets
* _special_ - special functions
* [stat](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-stat) - some statistical functions
* _struct_ - base data structures
* [units](https://github.com/mikhel1984/lc/wiki/Example:-units) - units conversation and other operations

Program includes a help system for most of the functions and modules. It also can be translated to other languages. Available now languages:
* _English (default)_
* _Esperanto (eo)_
* _Russian (ru)_

**Sonata LC** works in standard **Lua** interpreter. It is oriended on version _5.3_, but most of the functions are compatible also with _5.1_ and _5.2_ versions. In order to run it, call

    lua -i sonata.lua
